# Java-Practice-Question

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of basic Java practice questions that I am using to learn Java and improve my coding skills. If you're also new to Java or want to brush up on fundamentals, feel free to use these questions for your own practice.

## About

- 🧑‍💻 **Learning Journey**: This repo is part of my journey to learn Java from scratch.
- 📚 **Basic Questions**: The questions here focus on Java basics—variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and simple classes.
- 📝 **Practice-Oriented**: Each file typically contains one or more questions, and I try to solve them myself to understand coding concepts better.

## Structure

All questions and their solutions will be uploaded in the single folder:
